                <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="#">Profession</a>,<sup>[2]</sup> <a href="#">academic discipline</a><sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and <a href="#">applied art</a> whose activity consists in projecting<a href="#"> visual communications</a> visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of <a href="#">design</a><sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. Its practice involves <a href="#">creativity</a>, <a href="#">innovation</a> and <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> using manual or <a href="#">Sdigital tools</a>, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

                    The role of the <a href="#">graphic designer</a> in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the <a href="#">aviation</a> world<sup>[8]</sup> or  <a href="#">space exploration</a></a>.<sup>[9][10]</sup> In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With origins in <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and the <a href="#">Middle ages</a>,<sup>[11]</sup> graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of<a href="#">rise of printing</a> in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the <a href="#">Industrial Revolutiion</a>. From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with <a href="#">advertising</a> in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

                        <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:<sup>[15]</sup>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        An Enterprising Trades Union
                        <br>
                        … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic
                        design and decorating. …
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the <a href="#">California School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by <a href="#">Frederick Meyer.</a> <sup>[16]</sup>

                    In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of <a href="#">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, <a href="#">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>

                <h3>The advent of printing</h3>
                <h4>Main article: <a href="#">History of printing</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        In China, during the <a href="#">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books were produced using <a href="#">movable type</a> printing, making books widely available during the <a href="#">Song dynasty</a> (960–1279).<sup>[18]</sup>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, <a href="#">Johannes Gutenberg</a> developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using <a href="#">movable type</a> made with a new metal alloy<sup>[19]</sup> that created a revolution in the dissemination of information.<sup>[20]</sup>

                    <p>
                        In 1849, <a href="#">Henry Cole</a> became one of the major forces in <a href="#">design education</a> in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures. He organized the <a href="#">Great Exhibition</a> as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

                        <br>
                        From 1891 to 1896,<a href="#">William Morris' Kelmscott Pressy</a>  was a leader in graphic design associated with the <a href="#">Arts and Crafts movement</a>, creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,<sup>[21]</sup> in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.<sup>[22]</sup> Morris' work, along with the rest of the <a href="#">Private Press</a> movement, directly influenced<a href="#">Art Nouveau</a>.<sup>[23]</sup>

                        <a href="#">Will H. Bradley</a> became one of the notable graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled The Chap-Book.<sup>[24]</sup>

                        In 1917, <a href="#">Frederick H. Meyer</a>, director and instructor at the <a href="#">California School of Arts and Crafts</a>, taught a class entitled "Graphic Design and Lettering".<sup>[25]</sup> Raffe's Graphic Design, published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.<sup>[26]</sup> In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively.<sup>[27]</sup>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The signage in the <a href="#">London Underground</a> is a classic design example<sup>[28]</sup> of the <a href="#">modern era</a>. Although he lacked artistic training,  <a href="#">Frank Pick</a> led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of <a href="#">Edward Johnston</a> to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.<sup>[29]</sup>

                        <br>
                        In the 1920s, Soviet <a href="#">constructivism</a> applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for <a href="#">utilitarian</a> purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.<sup>[30]</sup>

                        <br>
                        <a href="#">Jan Tschichold</a> codified the principles of <a href="#">modern typography</a> in his 1928 book, New Typography.<sup>[31]</sup> He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.[citation needed] Tschichold, <a href="#">Bauhaus</a> typographers such as <a href="#">Herbert Bayer</a> and <a href="#">László Moholy-Nagy</a> and <a href="#">El Lissitzky</a> greatly influenced graphic design They pioneered production techniques<sup><a href="#">[citation needed]</a></sup> and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.<sup>[32]</sup>

                        The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with <a href="#">consumerism</a>. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the <a href="#">First Things First manifesto</a>. First launched by <a href="#">Ken Garland</a> in 1964, it was re-published as the <a href="#">First Things First 2000 manifesto</a> in 1999 in the magazine <a href="#">Emigre</a> 51<sup>[33]</sup> stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."<sup>[34]</sup>

                            Graphic design can have many applications, from <a href="#">road signs</a> to technical schematics and reference <a href="#">manuals</a>. It is often used in branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, <a href="#">packaging</a>, <a href="#">labelling</a> and text.

                            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information – known as <a href="#">information design</a>. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include <a href="#">Data and information visualization</a>, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with <a href="#">information graphics</a>.

                                The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.<sup><a href="#">[citation needed]</a></sup>

                                    Typography includes type design, modifying type <a href="#">glyphs</a> and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

                                    Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<sup>[35]</sup>

Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of <a href="#">type</a> (text),<a href="#">images</a> (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a <a href="#">dieline</a> for elements that are not printed with ink such as <a href="#">die</a>/<a href="#">laser</a><a href="#">cutting</a>, <a href="#">foil stamping</a> or <a href="#">blind embossing</a>.

                                            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of "designersaur." Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.<sup>[36]</sup>
