                <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="#">Profession</a>,<sup>[2]</sup> <a href="#">academic discipline</a><sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and <a href="#">applied art</a> whose activity consists in projecting<a href="#"> visual communications</a> visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of <a href="#">design</a><sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. Its practice involves <a href="#">creativity</a>, <a href="#">innovation</a> and <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> using manual or <a href="#">Sdigital tools</a>, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

                alt="Due to its interdisciplinary nature, graphic design can be performed in different areas of application: branding, technical and artistic drawing, signage, photography, image and video editing, 3D modeling, animation, programming, among other fields.[1]"

                    The role of the <a href="#">graphic designer</a> in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>

                    Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the <a href="#">aviation</a> world<sup>[8]</sup> or  <a href="#">space exploration</a></a>.<sup>[9][10]</sup> In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

                    With origins in <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and the <a href="#">Middle ages</a>,<sup>[11]</sup> graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of<a href="#">rise of printing</a> in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the <a href="#">Industrial Revolutiion</a>. From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with <a href="#">advertising</a> in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

                    In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of <a href="#">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, <a href="#">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>

                        In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).[18]
