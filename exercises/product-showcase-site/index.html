                Alpine Drops was created to restore and protect the skin’s natural barrier. Powerful ingredients packed full of antioxidants, vitamins and omega, fight against premature aging by smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, leaving skin looking rejuvenated. Rosehip oil, loaded with skin nourishing vitamins and essential fatty acids, delivers intense hydration, brightens the skin, and promotes collagen formation. Edelweiss heals skin cells and protects them against environmental stressors. Sea buckthorn plays a crucial role in regulating sebum levels in people with oily skin. Together, they work to soften the skin, reduce water loss, and promote skin elasticity.
