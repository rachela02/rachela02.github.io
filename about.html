        <h3>This image describes me because I love being in nature and it has soothing lines that can represent the air and the color sage green is very neutral and earth toned. </h3>
        <p>
            I aspire to be a graphic designer and have my own company up and running. I decided to go with F.I.R.S.T INSTITUTE due to their accelerated program and all that it had to offer. I currently reside in Miami, Fl but look forward to exploring new places around the world. I enjoy spending time being in nature or going for nice long walks. I love to paint in my free time and try out new foods! People would probably not guess that I am a pretty good cook in the kitchen. I am looking forward to graduating from F.I.R.S.T and finding sucess in my future endeavours.
