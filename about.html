        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
           My name is Rachel Alvarez, I am a graphic designer from Miami Flroida. I love to travel and experience art in many different forms. I aspire to reach people through my artistics skills and facilitate their needs. I spend most of my free time reading books or being out in nature, whether its at a park or my favorite the beach. I am currently located in Florida but look to relocate myself elsewhere.
